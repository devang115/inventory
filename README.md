React Inventory Management System
This is a simple Inventory Management System built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It allows you to:

Add, Edit, and Delete Inventory Items: Manage your stock of items with details like name, quantity, category, supplier, and stock level.

Add, Edit, and Delete Suppliers: Keep track of your suppliers with their contact information.

Search and Filter Inventory: Easily find items in your inventory by name, category, or supplier.

Local Storage Persistence: Your inventory data is automatically saved in your browser's local storage, so it's available even after you close the browser window.

Features

Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

Data persistence using browser's local storage

Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for both items and suppliers
